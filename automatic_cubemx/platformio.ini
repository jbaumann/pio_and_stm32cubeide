;[platformio]
; This is the root directory of the STM32CubeIDE project. Platformio can only
; take one source directory, thus we filter the sources using a
; source filter and additional build options to include the headers.
; This is set in the script and changing it here has no effect
;src_dir = ./
; The project headers are defined here to be available for the libraries as well
; This is no longer needed. Do not set it.
;include_dir = Core/Inc

[env:<board_definition>]
; The platform name is needed to identify the right build script.
; Do not change it.
platform = ststm32
; The board must fit the uC you selected in STM32CubeIDE. Otherwise there
; will be compile errors.
board = <board_definition>
; Setting the framework is not strictly necessary and might download additional
; resources that might not be needed. If you don‘t want that, change this setting
; to a comment.
; If you then have problems with compiling or linking, set it again to see whether
; it helps.
framework = stm32cube
; This is the actual script that forces platformio into compiling the
; STM32CubeIDE project.
extra_scripts = pre:setup_cubemx_env_auto.py
; The project option containing the directory in which CubeMX resides
;custom_repo_location = ~
; Set to the same toolchain as STM32CubeIDE
; For the mapping see
; https://api.registry.platformio.org/v3/packages/platformio/tool/toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi
platform_packages = toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi@1.90301.200702

; The name of the library directory in which the linked resources will
; be placed.
lib_deps = STLinkedResources
; Additional Build Flags
; Example: build_flags = -D DEBUG -D FREERTOS_TOTAL_RUNTIME_TIMER
