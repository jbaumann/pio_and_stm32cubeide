;[platformio]
; This is the root directory of the STM32CubeIDE project. Platformio can only
; take one source directory, thus we filter the sources using a
; source filter and additional build options to include the headers.
; This is set in the script and changing it here has no effect
;src_dir = ./
; The project headers are defined here to be available for the libraries as well
; This is no longer needed. Do not set it.
;include_dir = Core/Inc

[env:<board_definition>]
; The platform name is needed to identify the right build script.
; Do not change it.
platform = ststm32
; The board must fit the uC you selected in STM32CubeIDE. Otherwise there
; will be compile errors.
board = <board_definition>
; This value will be removed by the script but is needed to satisfy the
; build implementation. The actual framework name does not matter.
framework = stm32cube
; This is the actual script that forces platformio into compiling the
; STM32CubeIDE project.
extra_scripts = pre:setup_cubemx_env_auto.py
;The project option containing the directory in which CubeMX resides
;custom_repo_location = ~
; The name of the library directory in which the linked resources will
; be placed.
